Coursera DDP Project 2

This repository contains R code and an R Markdown file for Shiny application.
This is peer-graded Assignment for Coursera Developing Data Products course.
The application calculates the range of projectile motion, taking into consideration angle of throw and initial speed.
As an output, it gives distance & height of projectile motion, and draws the trajectory line of motion.

The final result can be seen on https://mkomisarz.shinyapps.io/basic_physics/.

The presentation explaining the application can be seen here:
